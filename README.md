## Sample applications
* **[Quick start React Native app]:** You can learn how the In-App-Payments React Native plugin is used by [getting started with the example app], a quick-start React Native app that lets you take a payment after completing 6 setup steps. 
* **Quick start backend app:** The [In-App Payments Server Quickstart](https://github.com/square/in-app-payments-server-quickstart) 
takes the nonce created by the React Native app and uses it to create a payment credited to your Square account. Use this backend sample to quickly create a complete payment flow.
